Objectives:
Download and extract Food 101 dataset.
Understand dataset structure and files.
Visualize random image from each of the 101 classes.
Split the image data into train and test using train.txt and test.txt.
Create a subset of data with few classes(3) - train_mini and test_mini for experimenting.
Fine tune Inception Pretrained model using Food 101 dataset.
Visualize accuracy and loss plots.
Predicting classes for new images from internet.
Scale up and fine tune Inceptionv3 model with 11 classes of data.
Model Explainability.
Summary of the things I tried.
Further improvements.
